# Speech emotion recognition project
- Machine learning course 2021/2022 - Unibo-

The purpose of this project is to present a series of experiments designed to determine the optimal 1D convolutional neural network architecture for emotion classification. The input to our model consists of raw audio tracks of spoken sentences, while the output is the predominant recognized emotion.
